# Personal Portfolio - React + Vite

This is a sleek and responsive portfolio website built using React and Vite, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and design style in a modern, interactive layout.

Currently, it includes:

- Smooth animations using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- Fully responsive design with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Dynamic scroll-based interactions
- A contact form with styled input fields
- Deployed live at [designelement.shop](https://www.designelement.shop/)
